# Dabao - A network visualiser

Dabao is a network visualiser with the aim of showing step-by-step, layer-by-layer, how communication happens on the Internet. It is created with the intent to answer, in-depth, the question: "How does my computer download a web page?". However, it's designed in such a way that other scenarios can be played out too.

## The name

In Singapore, to "dabao" or "打包" means to take-away food. More directly, it means to bale/pack or unpack something. This software helps to pack/unpack the contents of messages at different layers of the network stack, so the name seems somewhat fitting.
